= Heat Pump Heliotherm

This module reads the most important variables available via Modbus from a Heliotherm heatpump and maps them to OpenEMS
channels. The module is written to be used with the Heater interface methods.
When setEnableSignal() from the Heater interface is set to true with no other parameters like temperature specified,
the heatpump will turn on with default settings. The default settings are configurable in the config.
The heatpump can be controlled with setSetPointTemperature() and/or setSetPointPowerPercent().
A certain configuration of the pump is required for setSetPointPowerPercent() to work.
setSetPointPower() and related methods are not supported by this heater.
