= Heat Pump Alpha Innotec

This module reads the most important variables available via Modbus from an Alpha Innotec heat pump and maps them to OpenEMS channels.
WriteChannels can be used to send commands to the heat pump via setter methods in HeatpumpAlphaInnotecChannel and HeatpumpSmartGridGeneralizedChannel.
