= Condition Applier

== WIP

 Will be used to apply a result after certain configured input
 You will be able to do apply channels, basic operations etc etc, and write them into a channel or apply it within a defined method.


 This Bundles provides at the moment only a prototype and a fraction of functionality that is planned.
It checks if the given channel equals/greater/less than a value and then answers with a value to a channel
if the condition applied.
