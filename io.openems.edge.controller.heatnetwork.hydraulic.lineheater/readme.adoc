= Controller Heatnetwork HydraulicLineHeater

A controller for energy optimization.
Controller checks if a hydraulic line is warm enough if for example the decentralizedHeater wants to heat a buffer.
There can also be a remote Signal for controlling it.

== Example

1. MinMax and Valve
- You want to control a Valve within a line.
By controlling the min and Max value.
- Configure maxValveValue and minValveValue (You can adapt them with a controller later on)
- set lineHeaterType to OneChannel
- set onlyMaxMin to true
- set valveBypass

2. OneChannel
- You want to write into any Channel
- set LineHeaterType to OneChannel
- set channelAddress

3. Valve
- Same as MinMax and Valve, without ticking "only MinMax"
