= Thermometer Threshold

A Threshold Thermometer getting a "real" Thermometer and set the Temperature by discrete values (depending on threshold value).
Has a SetPoint and Thermometer state and calling components can check, if their setPointTemperature/given Temperature is above/below the "fictional" Temperature depending on Thermometer state.

== Example

Threshold = 10dc Real temperature = 543dc "Fictional" Temperature becomes 540 dC if Temperature becomes 551 -> Fictional will be 550dc and "Rising" if State is Rising -> and Temperature check -> 550dc > fictional Temperature -> return true (because temperature rises) else if state is falling and TemperatureCheck 550dc > fictional Temperature -> return false.

Implemented Natures::
- ThresholdThermometer
- Thermometer
