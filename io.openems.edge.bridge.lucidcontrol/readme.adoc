The support for LucidControl Devices from

Remember to get their Software at :

NOTE: This Implementation only supports Linux/Raspbian devices and POSITIVE Voltage LucidIOs.(Not +-5V and +-10V)

== Description

This Bridge/Api provides the Communication with LucidControl Modules, and it's Devices.
The Bridge handles the Communication between OpenEMS and the LucidControl Software, by calling the Shell, executing a command to call the LucidControl Software, and getting the Output (on Read) to get the current Volt input and write into the LucidControlDevice.

First you have to Configure a Bridge, followed by a Module and in the end n Devices (n determined by connectors to the LucidModule itself.)

== Example

1. Configure Bridge LucidControl and add the Path to the LucidIoControl Software.
The Bridge is in Singleton Pattern.

2. Configure a Module.
The important part here is the Module Path.
The default path ist /dev/ttyACM0 where following devices, login with ttyACM'X' where 'X'' represents a number.

3. Last but not Least configure the device.
The Device connected to a Module.
The Devices are Split into In and Output devices.
Both Devices need a ModuleId and a PinPosition (starting with 0) The Input Devices need a "MaxPressure".
Allowing the mapping of Max Voltage to the max pressure -> and therefore the Pressure can be calculated.
The Output device needs a more detailed configuration.
Where a  Threshold maps a Value.
When Writing from a Device to another some lost Voltage can be measrued e.g. 50% != 50% but 45% -> A Threshold Value (in Volt) will be added to the calculated value.
