ToDo: The heater can do setpoint power percent and setpoint temperature. Currently only default values for
setpoint power percent are set.

Unclear how to switch to setpoint temperature mode.
Speculation:
DEVICE_POWER_MODE -> 255 is needed for sure.
DEVICE_OPERATION_MODE -> not sure here. Probably 0 or 1.
