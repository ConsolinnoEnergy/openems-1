= Timer

This Bundle provides an ExceptionalState and an ExceptionalStateHandler.
The ExceptionalState is a Nature that allows Components to react to an ExceptionalState.

== Example
An Error occurred, and you need to interrupt Controller Units -> Set Exceptional State and a corresponding value
Components react to the Value if an ExceptionalState is active.

== Hint
To see if an ExceptionalState is active use the ExceptionalStateHandler
